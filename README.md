# Patient_Cluster_Analysis
Using K-Means clustering, elderly hip-fracture patients are grouped based on the similarity of age, length of stay (LOS) and elapsed time to surgery. We utilise a dataset retrieved from the Irish Hip fracture Database (IHFD) covering the period of two years (2013â€“2014). Our results suggest the presence of three coherent clusters of patients. Through cluster analysis, possible correlations are explored in relation to patient characteristics, care-related factors, and patient outcomes.
